## Task 1: Reproducing and improving figures

```{r load-wrangle}
# load and wrangle the data here

  # assign readable interventions to groups

### Figure 3 - Kai (shaper)
```{r figure-3}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 3. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 3 and why you consider this an improvement.

### Figure 4 - James
```{r figure-4}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 4. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 4 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 5 - Fimi
```{r figure-5}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 5. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 5 and why you consider this an improvement.
