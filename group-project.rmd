## Task 1: Reproducing and improving figures

```{r load-wrangle}
# load and wrangle the data here
data <- read_csv(here("data/HIIT-postpartum-depression.csv")) %>% 
  clean_names()
  
data[data == "#NULL!"] <- NA # standardising missing values to NA's instead of "#NULL!"
```


### Figure 3 - Kai (shaper)
```{r figure-3}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 3. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 3 and why you consider this an improvement.

```


### Figure 4 - James
```{r figure-4}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 4. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 4 and why you consider this an improvement.
```


### Figure 5 - Fimi
```{r figure-5}
# Write your code for reproducing, and then improving Figure 5. Present both figures together. Under the figures, explain how you've improved Figure 5 and why you consider this an improvement.

# original reproduction of figure 5
fig5 <- data %>% 
   mutate(
    pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale = as.numeric(pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale),
    post_sf12_pcs = as.numeric(post_sf12_pcs),
    postnatal_sf_12_pcs = as.numeric(postnatal_sf_12_pcs)
  ) %>% 
  select(participant_code,intervention_group,pre_sf_12_pcs_physicalhealthscale,post_sf12_pcs,postnatal_sf_12_pcs) %>%

    cols = c(
